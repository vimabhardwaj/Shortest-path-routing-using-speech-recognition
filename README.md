# Shortest-path-routing-using-speech-recognition

The objective of project is to find the shortest route between two places using 
speech recognition. The user can give input either by uploading csv file or by 
manually typing. The source location and the destination location can be 
accessed through voice. The output will show the route and the shortest 
distance as well.
